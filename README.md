# Pan_Card_Detail_Detection
In this Model, I have detected details of Pan Card from image and had tried saving it in csv format. 
1) Download any dataset from Kaggle or UCI of Pan Cards or You may download each and every pancard and resize it by using image resizer.
2) We need to install Pytorch and CV2 for the following Project. Then we need to load our detection model. Select an image.
3) For showing up the image in jupyter notebook we need to install Matplotlib.pyplot as its used for plotting images and graphs.
4) We would get our image as its pixels are stored in the form of an array, we just want those specific coordinates to display limited data of that particular image.
5) Thus, we can get details of the Pan Card using OCR detection model in a Text Format.
